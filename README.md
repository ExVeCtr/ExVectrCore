# VectrCore
Part of the VECTR project. 
VectrCore's main purpose is to add a hardware abstraction and control layer to allow TrueControl projects to run on different platforms and systems seamlessly or close to little implementation. VectrCore also adds a suite of utilities for high level math, control and data flow.
## **This project is under initial development. Things will probably break.**
## Current goal roadmap:
- [ ] Do everything -_-. This consists of below lines. Will probably be made more concrete in the future.
- [X] Port, modify and clean/fix utilities from EasyVTOL.
- [ ] Plan hardware abstraction layer (HAL).
- [ ] Implement Basic HAL functions
- [ ] Create Arduino HAL Implementation for testing (In external library. Not part of VectrCore).
- [ ] Documentation.
## To implement onto a platform:##
- A library must be made to implement multiple functions in the hardware abstraction layer:
    - These will be named in the future once basic implementation is finished.
