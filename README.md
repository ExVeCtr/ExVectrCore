# ExVectrCore
Part of the EXVECTR project. 
ExVectrCore adds a suite of utilities for high level math, control and data flow.
## **This project is under initial development. Things will probably break.**
## Current goal roadmap:
- [X] Port, modify and clean/fix utilities from EasyVTOL.
- [ ] Add event utilities.
- [ ] Redo scheduling.
- [ ] Documentation.
## To implement onto a platform:##
- A library must be made to implement multiple functions in the hardware abstraction layer:
    - These will be named in the future once basic implementation is finished.
